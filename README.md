# UnityShadowReplay2D
This demo implements a core gameplay loop where players control a 2D character and generate "action shadows" that replicate their movements. The shadows don’t just interpolate positions—they recreate inputs (movement/jumps) with independent physics, providing a more realistic and interactive replication experience.
